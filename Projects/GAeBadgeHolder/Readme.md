    Subject: Interalliance summer camp badges

    Jim,

                    I'm looking for a base to hold all the components for the electronic badges we are building for the Interalliance Summer Camp kids.  If we had a laser cutter this would be a lot easier, but since we don't have one (yet), I was hoping we could make these fairly easily on the 3D printer.  We need a total of 35 of them.  To give you some idea of what I'm picturing in my head, I'm thinking of basically a blend of these three items:

    [cid:image001.png@01D2B369.754156C0]
    Basic badge format with lanyard clip hole at top

    [Arduino and Breadboard Holder]
    Arduino Uno base plate (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11235)

    [cid:image005.png@01D2B36A.3FE938C0]
    Different Uno base plate (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:222680)

    Here's the list of actual parts we're using:

    *         Arduino Uno - $3.73 - www.ebay.com/itm/162133632940<http://www.ebay.com/itm/162133632940>
    *         LCD Shield - $3 - www.ebay.com/itm/121726845068<http://www.ebay.com/itm/121726845068>
    [cid:image003.png@01D2B390.6230BEF0]
    *         Battery holder - $1 - www.ebay.com/itm/141891902509<http://www.ebay.com/itm/141891902509>
    [cid:image004.png@01D2B390.6230BEF0]
    Let me know if that's enough to get you started.

    Thanks,
    Jeremy
